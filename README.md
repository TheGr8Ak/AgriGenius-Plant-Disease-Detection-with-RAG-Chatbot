# AgriGenius-Plant-Disease-Detection-with-RAG-Chatbot

This project aims to create a **real-time agricultural plant disease detection system** that identifies diseases in various plant species from images of their leaves. The system processes images using a **custom CNN with ResNet-inspired architecture** and provides detailed information and advice on detected diseases through an integrated **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot**.

## **Project Overview**

The AgriGenius plant disease detection system is designed to:

- Identify **multiple disease classes** across different plant species (e.g., Apple scab, Tomato late blight)
- Provide **real-time disease detection** from uploaded plant leaf images
- Offer **detailed information** about detected diseases through a conversational interface
- Suggest **treatment recommendations** and **prevention strategies** for identified plant diseases

## **Technologies Used**

- **PyTorch & torchvision**: For deep learning model development and training
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data handling and manipulation
- **PIL**: For image processing
- **LangChain**: For building the RAG system
- **HuggingFaceHub**: For accessing the Mistral-7B-Instruct/any other model
- **FAISS**: For vector store implementation
- **Gradio**: For building the interactive web interface
- **Colorama**: For console styling

## **Key Features**

1. **Dataset Collection**  
   The project uses the New Plant Diseases Dataset from Kaggle, containing RGB images of plant leaves organized by disease classes. The dataset includes training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Images are transformed into tensors with size 256×256×3 and normalized for input to the CNN model.

3. **Model Architecture**  
   A **Custom CNN with ResNet-inspired architecture** (CNN_NeuralNet) is used for disease detection, featuring convolutional blocks with BatchNorm, ReLU activation, skip connections, MaxPooling layers, and a fully connected classifier.

4. **Training**  
   The model is trained using cross-entropy loss with the Adam optimizer and OneCycleLR scheduler. Training includes gradient clipping and weight decay for regularization.

5. **Prediction and Real-Time Recognition**  
   The trained model processes uploaded images in real-time to predict plant disease classes with high accuracy.

6. **Validation**  
   The model is validated using a pre-defined validation set with performance metrics including validation loss and accuracy.

7. **RAG Chatbot Integration**  
   An advanced feature that allows users to ask questions about detected diseases. The system uses:
   - A comprehensive knowledge base of plant disease information
   - Mistral-7B-Instruct/any other model for text generation
   - FAISS vector store with sentence-transformer embeddings for efficient information retrieval

8. **Tools and Libraries**  
   The project leverages various tools for deep learning, data handling, LLM integration, visualization, and user interface development.

9. **Real-Time Application**  
   Features a **Gradio-based interface** allowing users to upload plant images and interact with the chatbot about detected diseases.

10. **Deployment Considerations**  
    The model is saved as plant_disease_model.pth for persistence and is designed to run in a Colab environment with shared link functionality.
